This guarantees that no requirement is left unvalidated, and the overall scope of the system is fully covered during testing. o Consistency The validation approach ensures that no conflicting requirements or contradictory validation methods exist across the specification. Terminology and test criteria are applied uniformly, minimizing ambiguity and reducing the risk of misinterpretation during implementation or testing. o Traceability Each requirement is linked directly to its corresponding acceptance test, establishing clear bidirectional traceability.

Introduction In software engineering, the process of gathering requirements from stakeholders is a crucial step in developing a successful software system. A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) serves as a formal agreement between stakeholders and developers, outlining what the system will do and under what constraints. This document illustrates the process of gathering, analyzing, and specifying both functional and non-functional requirements using a Library Management System as an example. 2.",

The software engineer employs interviews, questionnaires, document analysis, and observation to gather both explicit and implicit requirements. Prototypes and use cases may also be used to validate understanding. The elicited requirements are documented and refined through iterative discussions. 4. Functional Requirements Functional requirements define what the system should do its specific behavior and functionalities. For the Library Management System, the following functional requirements were gathered from stakeholders: ID Functional Requirement FR1 FR2 FR3 The system shall allow members to search for books by title, author, category, or ISBN. The system shall allow members to borrow and return books using their library accounts. The system shall enable administrators to add, edit, or remove books from the catalog. FR4 FR5 The system shall send automated email notifications for overdue books. The system shall generate usage and inventory reports for administrators. 5. Non-Functional Requirements Non- functional requirements specify system qualities and constraints, describing how the system performs its functions. The following non-functional requirements were defined through stakeholder discussions: ID Non-Functional Requirement NFR1 NFR2 NFR3 The system shall provide a response time of less than 3 seconds for search queries. The system shall ensure data confidentiality through role-based access control. The system shall be available 99.5% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance. NFR4 NFR5 The user interface shall be intuitive and comply with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1).",

This guarantees that no requirement is left unvalidated, and the overall scope of the system is fully covered during testing. o Consistency The validation approach ensures that no conflicting requirements or contradictory validation methods exist across the specification. Terminology and test criteria are applied uniformly, minimizing ambiguity and reducing the risk of misinterpretation during implementation or testing. o Traceability Each requirement is linked directly to its corresponding acceptance test, establishing clear bidirectional traceability.

This guarantees that no requirement is left unvalidated, and the overall scope of the system is fully covered during testing. o Consistency The validation approach ensures that no conflicting requirements or contradictory validation methods exist across the specification. Terminology and test criteria are applied uniformly, minimizing ambiguity and reducing the risk of misinterpretation during implementation or testing. o Traceability Each requirement is linked directly to its corresponding acceptance test, establishing clear bidirectional traceability.

The software engineer employs interviews, questionnaires, document analysis, and observation to gather both explicit and implicit requirements. Prototypes and use cases may also be used to validate understanding. The elicited requirements are documented and refined through iterative discussions. 4. Functional Requirements Functional requirements define what the system should do its specific behavior and functionalities. For the Library Management System, the following functional requirements were gathered from stakeholders: ID Functional Requirement FR1 FR2 FR3 The system shall allow members to search for books by title, author, category, or ISBN. The system shall allow members to borrow and return books using their library accounts. The system shall enable administrators to add, edit, or remove books from the catalog. FR4 FR5 The system shall send automated email notifications for overdue books. The system shall generate usage and inventory reports for administrators. 5. Non-Functional Requirements Non- functional requirements specify system qualities and constraints, describing how the system performs its functions. The following non-functional requirements were defined through stakeholder discussions: ID Non-Functional Requirement NFR1 NFR2 NFR3 The system shall provide a response time of less than 3 seconds for search queries. The system shall ensure data confidentiality through role-based access control. The system shall be available 99.5% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance.
