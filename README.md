# Smart Classify System (Flask + Tailwind + SVM demo)

This is a ready-to-run demo project for your FYP:
- Flask backend
- Tailwind CSS frontend (via CDN)
- Tiny SVM demo (or rule-based fallback if sklearn is not available)
- Text/docx/pdf upload and per-line classification

## How to use

1. Open the project in VS Code:
   - Path: `/mnt/data/smart-classify-system`

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd smart-classify-system/backend
   python -m venv venv
   # activate venv first: venv\Scripts\activate  (Windows) or source venv/bin/activate (mac/linux)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

3. Train model (optional - the repo includes model.pkl generated by train script):
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. Run app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Notes about the model
- The training script `train_model.py` trains a tiny LinearSVC on a synthetic dataset for demo.
- If `scikit-learn` is not available in your environment, the script will save a simple rule-based fallback model instead.
- `classifier.py` automatically loads `model.pkl` and uses SVM if present, otherwise falls back to rules.
